## Calibration of stochastic local volatility model via neural networks

Eric Brunner, eric.brunner@uranus.uni-freiburg.de

We try to calibrate stochastic local volatility models by learning the local volatility function by means of a neural network. The folder heston_slv_calibration contains a calibration of both the stochastic and the local volatility part by means of neural networks.

Remarks:
Requires Tensorflow 1.15 and Keras 2.3.1..
