	abstract = {In the past ﬁve years, deep learning methods have become state-of-the-art in solving various inverse problems. Before such approaches can ﬁnd application in safety-critical ﬁelds, a veriﬁcation of their reliability appears mandatory. Recent works have pointed out instabilities of deep neural networks for several image reconstruction tasks. In analogy to adversarial attacks in classiﬁcation, it was shown that slight distortions in the input domain may cause severe artifacts. The present article sheds new light on this concern, by conducting an extensive study of the robustness of deep-learning-based algorithms for solving underdetermined inverse problems. This covers compressed sensing with Gaussian measurements as well as image recovery from Fourier and Radon measurements, including a real-world scenario for magnetic resonance imaging (using the NYU-fastMRI dataset). Our main focus is on computing adversarial perturbations of the measurements that maximize the reconstruction error. A distinctive feature of our approach is the quantitative and qualitative comparison with total-variation minimization, which serves as a provably robust reference method. In contrast to previous ﬁndings, our results reveal that standard end-to-end network architectures are not only resilient against statistical noise, but also against adversarial perturbations. All considered networks are trained by common deep learning techniques, without sophisticated defense strategies.},

	abstract = {Recovering a function or high-dimensional parameter vector from indirect measurements is a central task in various scientific areas. Several methods for solving such inverse problems are well developed and well understood. Recently, novel algorithms using deep learning and neural networks for inverse problems appeared. While still in their infancy, these techniques show astonishing performance for applications like low-dose CT or various sparse data problems. However, there are few theoretical results for deep learning in inverse problems. In this paper, we establish a complete convergence analysis for the proposed NETT (network Tikhonov) approach to inverse problems. NETT considers nearly data-consistent solutions having small value of a regularizer defined by a trained neural network. We derive well-posedness results and quantitative error estimates, and propose a possible strategy for training the regularizer. Our theoretical results and framework are different from any previous work using neural networks for solving inverse problems. A possible data driven regularizer is proposed. Numerical results are presented for a tomographic sparse data problem, which demonstrate good performance of NETT even for unknowns of different type from the training data. To derive the convergence and convergence rates results we introduce a new framework based on the absolute Bregman distance generalizing the standard Bregman distance from the convex to the non-convex case.},

	abstract = {We present a consistent neural network based calibration method for a number of volatility models-including the rough volatility family-that performs the calibration task within a few milliseconds for the full implied volatility surface.The aim of neural networks in this work is an off-line approximation of complex pricing functions, which are difficult to represent or time-consuming to evaluate by other means. We highlight how this perspective opens new horizons for quantitative modelling: The calibration bottleneck posed by a slow pricing of derivative contracts is lifted. This brings several model families (such as rough volatility models) within the scope of applicability in industry practice. As customary for machine learning, the form in which information from available data is extracted and stored is crucial for network performance. With this in mind we discuss how our approach addresses the usual challenges of machine learning solutions in a financial context (availability of training data, interpretability of results for regulators, control over generalisation errors). We present specific architectures for price approximation and calibration and optimize these with respect different objectives regarding accuracy, speed and robustness. We also find that including the intermediate step of learning pricing functions of (classical or rough) models before calibration significantly improves network performance compared to direct calibration to data.},

This is the class of financial models that combines the local and stochastic volatility features and has been subject of the attention by many researchers recently. More precisely, given a local volatility surface and a choice of stochastic volatility parameters, we calibrate the corresponding leverage function. Our approach makes use of regularization techniques from the inverse-problem theory, respecting the integrity of the data and thus avoiding data interpolation. The result is a stable and robust algorithm which is resilient to instabilities in the regions of low probability density of the spot price and of the instantaneous variance. We substantiate our claims with numerical experiments using simulated as well as real data.},

We build upon the particle method introduced by Guyon and Henry-Labordère  [Nonlinear Option Pricing, Chapman and Hall, 2013, Chapter 11] and combine it with new variance reduction techniques in order to accelerate convergence. We use control variates derived from the following: a calibrated pure local volatility model, a two-factor Heston-type LSV model (both with deterministic rates), and the stochastic (CIR) short rates. The method can be applied to a large class of hybrid LSV models and is not restricted to our particular choice of the diffusion. However, we address in the paper some specific difficulties arising from the Heston model, notably by a new PDE formulation and finite element solution to bypass the singularities of the density when zero is attainable by the variance. The calibration procedure is performed on market data for the EUR-USD currency pair and has a comparable run-time to the PDE calibration of a two-factor LSV model alone.},

We formulate the problem as a convex optimisation problem, for which we provide a dual formulation.
